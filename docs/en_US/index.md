# HTML Display plugin

Very simple plugin allowing you to put the HTML / Javascript / CSS code you want on its equipment tile.

>**Important**

>The plugin requires knowing how to code in HTML, Javascript and CSS, no support will be provided by the Jeedom team on the code of your widget.

Use cases can be :

- unique menu for designs
- inclusion of information outside Jeedom

>**Important**
>
>As a reminder, designs ALWAYS use the dashboard version of the code (whether you are on mobile or desktop)
